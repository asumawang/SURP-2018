#### Backround

Presently, there are two major frontiers in artificial intelligent research that each possess their own strengths and weaknesses in pursuit of designing artificial agents: **deep learning** and **causal inference**. 

##### Deep Learning: Perception

Deep networks have the power to learn and recognize **abstract features** present in high dimensional, highly redundant pieces of data (like images, or text), and use those features to solve simple task: like **clasification** or adding a set **labels** to the image.

The kind of problems that deep learning has solved are **perception tasks** including **seeing** (visual object recognition), **reading** (text understanding), and **hearing** (speech recognition). 

##### Causal Inference: Thinking

Causal Inference uses what we call **probabilistic graphical models** to allow artificial agents to make decisions using **logic deduction**, and **dealing with uncertainty** .

The kind of problems that causal inference solves are assiciated with the ability of **thinking**

#### Model: Causal Cognitive Network

This research will attempt to marry two disciplines at the forefront of AI research whose camps have yet to seriously meet. 

We are working towards building an agent that will harvest the power of deep learning for perception tasks by analyzing high dimensional input and then translating it into **meaningful labels** that it can then make use of via causal inference, to solve more complex tasks like **counterfactual reasoning**.

Our aim is to build a working prototype of an artificial agent that can solve a non-trivial task using perception and inference. Some. Ideas include the medical domain, robotics and recommendation systems.
