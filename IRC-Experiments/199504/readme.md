# Using IRC with python3
Here I present a workflow for using the IRC poker data in a python script.
1. Run the script `format.sh`
This script will format the data as a pandas dataframe that can be easily used in python. The details of the implementation, as well as the inner workings of the script are explained as comments in the file. You also need to have `join_data.py` stored in the same folder.
2. Run python scrip `play_games.py` to simmulate games from the dataset.
